# sleepyfran's homepage

This is the code behind my little corner of the internet, which can be found at [sleepyfran.me](https://sleepyfran.me).

If for whatever reason you're looking into how to run this locally, the entire site uses Astro, so head over to the [Astro documentation](https://docs.astro.build/) for more information.

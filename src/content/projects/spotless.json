  "description": "When I listen to music I rarely listen to individual songs but rather to full albums, and I always missed a way to quickly play all albums of a band either shuffled or ordered in a specific way. Or just to browse my library by genre (remember the good old iTunes days?). So I made a web-app that connects with your Spotify account and does just that. Spotless is still available, but I've made a new version of the same idea with support for more providers called Echo, it's up in this page :^)",

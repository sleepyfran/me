    <h1>Hi! I'm Fran and this is my little internet corner.</h1>
    <main>
      <p>
        This place, whatever it is it's supposed to be, is not quite ready yet,
        but these are some of the cool things I've worked or am currently
        working on:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/sleepyfran/duets">duets</a>: I'm pretty
          sure I'll be 80 by the time I'll finish this, but this is my little
          redemption to text-based games in the form of a music/life simulation
          game. I keep adding features and changing the game mechanics, but it's
          already playable if text-based games are your jam (hah, get that?).
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://sleepyfran.github.io/readder/">readder</a>: A little
          web-app that let's you read stuff from Reddit based on how much time
          you have.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://sleepyfran.github.io/spotless/">spotless</a>: When I
          listen to music I rarely listen to individual songs but rather to full
          albums, and I always missed a way to quickly play all albums of a band
          either shuffled or ordered in a specific way. Or just to browse my
          library by genre (remember the good old iTunes days?). So I made a
          web-app that connects with your Spotify account and does just that.
          I'm currently rewriting it to work with multiple providers since I've
          also started to buy a lot more music and keep it locally, but it's
          still very WIP, so in the meantime spotless all the things! :^)
        </li>
        <li>
          Once in a blue moon I make music under the name of
          <a href="https://twistedfaceoffadingbeauty.bandcamp.com"
            >Twisted Face of Fading Beauty</a
          >, which 14-year-old me, obsessed with Post-Rock bands with long names
          thought was a great idea. Anyways, I promise the music is not half as
          bad as the name. Oh, and since we're talking music, I was also part of
          a band called
          <a href="https://lastfarewell.bandcamp.com/">Last Farewell</a> back when
          I lived in Spain where we made some pretty cool blackgaze/post-hardcore
          music.
        </li>
        <li>
          I also have a little
          <a href="/blog/">blog</a>
          that I barely update with random articles. The most interesting probably
          being my article on
          <a href="/blog/fsharp-computation-expressions/"
            >F#'s computation expressions</a
          >
          for the 2022 F# Advent Calendar.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        I honestly don't even know what I'm gonna do with this page, but you
        know that feeling when you feel like you just <em>need</em> to have that
        domain? Yeah, me too.
